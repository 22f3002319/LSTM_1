# 📈 LSTM_1

An AI-powered web application that predicts stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The app takes a stock ticker as input and generates both short-term predictions and future forecasts, visualized via dynamic graphs.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time stock data fetching via `yFinance`
- LSTM-based deep learning model for time series forecasting
- Future price prediction for up to 30 days
- Interactive web interface built with Flask and HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Graphical output rendered using Matplotlib and served as base64 images
- Clean and responsive UI with loading indicators and error handling
